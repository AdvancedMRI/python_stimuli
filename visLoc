echo "ODC stimulus written for half-screen. Open with textedit for help and setting parameters"

# stimuli for ODC localisation, as copied from Yacoub et al 2007
# input arguments:
# 1 - blockLength - How long each eye is stimulated for
# 2 - numBlocks - How many blocks of monocular stimulation to run for (must be even for equal number of R and L)
# 3 - nullPeriod - how long the blank period at the beginning of the session should run for
# 4 - stimSize - size of the stimulus in proportion to screen height
# 5 - initEye - which eye to start with


# parameters can be set using the input arguments above - if the stimulus goes off the edge of the screen, reduce stimSize, or increase if there's dead-space at the edge of the screen.'
# stimulus length = (blockLength*numBlocks)+nullPeriod
